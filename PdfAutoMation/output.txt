Going through various resources and articles online I could find two existing voice-based system alert 
system in Chrysler vehicles and Nissan vehicles. 
 
Chrysler Electronic Voice Alert (EVA) System. 

Electronic voice alert (EVA) was an option available on many Chrysler K-car-based vehicles in the mid-
1980s. Chrysler and Dodge used technology of the Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips, that were also 
used in the Speak & Spell toy. The EVA would automatically lower the radio volume and deliver eleven 
different spoken warning messages to drivers using a speech synthesizer in 24 certain models. A similar 
system was used in 1984 to 1986 Nissan 300ZX, Nissan 200SX, and the Nissan Maxima GL and GLE models. 
The messages are played from a miniature phonograph record, similar as used in speaking dolls. 

The EVA was available on the Chrysler LeBaron (and the optional Mark Cross Edition), Chrysler Town and 
Country Wagon, Chrysler Fifth Avenue, Chrysler New Yorker, Chrysler Laser, Dodge Daytona, and Dodge 
600 between 1983 and 1988. Models sold in Canada accommodated both English and French. Models 
sold in Mexico spoke Spanish.  

Generally paired with a digital instrument cluster and considered the height of technology at the time, 
many drivers grew weary of the system constantly admonishing them to fasten their seatbelts and turned 
it off via removing a fuse, which sometimes deactivates the fuel gauge.[15] Later models had the option 
to be turned off via a switch in the glovebox. 
A few years after creating the world’s first electronic travel computer   (showing the average speed and 
gas mileage, and estimated the range until running out of gas), Chrysler brought out the Electronic Voice 
Alert (EVA) system. Electronic Voice Alert was an advanced technology for the time — it was launched in 
1983 car models coming as it did before Macintosh computers, much less iPods, Siri, or the common use 
of voice-recognition/voice-synthesizing answering machines.
